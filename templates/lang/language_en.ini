The wiki article <a href="https://wiki.loxberry.de/konfiguration/widget_help/widget_mqtt/mqtt_gateway/mqtt_schritt_fur_schritt_mqtt_loxone">MQTT - Step by step: MQTT â†’ Loxone</a> explains how to integrate the data into Loxone via a virtual input. The requirements, as mentioned at the beginning of the article are already fulfilled when the Luxtronik 2 plugin has been fully configured. To check, you can check in the <a href="/admin/system/mqtt-gateway.cgi?form=incoming">Incoming overview of the MQTT plugin</a> whether data is already available.</p>"
